Created an HTTP server in Node.js that handles multiple routes. It logs incoming requests and appends them to a log.txt file. Require method is used to import different modules like fs, http, and url. Depending on the URL path and request method, the server responds with different content, such as a home page, search results, or a signup form. It also processes query parameters like a user's name or search query. A 404 error is returned for undefined routes.
